I am a first-year student of MPP. I am interested in crime rate and population change. 
Goal
I want to learn more about visualizing different kinds of data and visualize them.
I want to gain the basic skills of Python in Jupyter, Learn how to make a map, and change the items in the map.
I'm hoping to use this course to learn more about how to map to help me to do research.
